# Employee Attrition Predictor  

## Project Overview
‚ÄúWhy do our employees leave?‚Äù This Streamlit web-app gives HR professionals a clear, interpretable answer.  
Upload a **single record** or an entire **CSV file** and the model will:

* Predict the probability an employee will quit (`Attrition Yes/No`)
* Highlight their **risk tier** (Low ¬∑ Moderate ¬∑ High)
* Explain *why* with interactive **SHAP** visualisations  
  (global beeswarm, decision path, local force plot, feature-impact bar)

The app blends traditional HR fields (age, salary, tenure) with key **psychological factors** such as  
job satisfaction, engagement, work‚Äìlife balance and burnout indicators.

---

## Objectives
- Predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques.
- Understand psychological and organizational drivers behind attrition.
- Offer explainable AI insights to support HR decision-making.
- Enable both individual predictions and batch analysis.
- Visualize results using SHAP force plots, beeswarm plots, and decision paths.

---

## Features
- **Real-time Attrition Prediction**: Predict whether an employee is at risk of leaving the organization.
- **Batch CSV Upload**: Upload a dataset of employees for multi-row predictions and exportable results.
- **Risk Categorization**: Displays probability-based risk levels ‚Äî Low, Moderate, or High.
- **SHAP Explanations**: Understand which features drive each prediction (Force plot, Beeswarm, Decision plot).
- **Interactive Feature Impact**: Explore how individual features influence the prediction.
- **Download & Clear History**: Save prediction logs as CSV or clear them with one click.
- **Sample Data & Reset**: Test the app with sample inputs or reset the form instantly.
- **Psychology-Aligned Inputs**: Includes measures of job satisfaction, involvement, work-life balance, and more.

---

## Psychological Relevance
The app incorporates key concepts from Organizational Psychology:
- **Job Satisfaction**
- **Burnout & Tenure Effects**
- **Employee Engagement**
- **Work‚ÄìLife Balance**
- **Overtime & Performance Pressure**

## Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python
- **Modeling**: scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization & Interpretation**: SHAP, matplotlib
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Web App**: Streamlit

---

## Usage
To use the app:

1. **Run locally with Streamlit:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

2. **Inside the app:**
- Use the sidebar to input employee details or load sample data.
- Optionally upload a CSV file for batch prediction.
- Click Run Prediction to view risk probability and SHAP-based explanations.
- Use Interactive Feature Impact to understand the effect of each factor.
- Download or clear the prediction history as needed.

Inputs include dropdowns and sliders based on employee attributes. SHAP visualizations will explain each prediction transparently.
